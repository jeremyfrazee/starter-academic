Hi! My name is Jeremy Frazee and I am a graduating senior at Michigan State University (MSU) majoring in Economics and Political Theory with minors in Data Analytics and Public Relations. In addition, my course work has given me experience in Python, R, Stata, and SQL. I have [experience](https://www.jeremyfrazee.com/#experience) in campaigns, government, and communications research. Check out some of my [projects](https://www.jeremyfrazee.com/project/), some examples including an [econometric analysis of homeless bills of rights](https://www.jeremyfrazee.com/project/econfinal.pdf) or [analyzing campaign finance data](https://www.jeremyfrazee.com/project/campaignfinance.pdf). In my freetime, I like running üèÉ, camping üèïÔ∏è, playing strategy video games üéÆ.

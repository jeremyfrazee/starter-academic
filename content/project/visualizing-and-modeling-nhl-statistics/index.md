title: Visualizing and Modeling NHL Statistics
date: 2021-04-11T15:25:47.182Z
summary: In this project, I use Python and data analysis modules (Pandas, NumPy,
  and Matplotlib) to visualize National Hockey League team and player
  statistics. I also use the polyfit function and create models to examine the
  impacts of certain variables on goals scored by players.
